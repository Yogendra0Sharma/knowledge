### Init

```
git init
```

Initializes a repository in an existing directory. This will create `.git` hidden folder, a location where Git operates.

### Status

```
git status
```

Shows the working tree status.

### Add

```
git add some-file.txt
```

This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content `staged` for the next commit.

Wildcards are supported, e.g. `git add '*.txt'` or you can add all files by `git add .`

### Commit

```
git commit -m "Some message"
```

Records changes to the repository. By using `-m` flag, a custom message will be added with commit.

```
git commit -a -m "Some message"
```

By using `-a` flag, command will also do `git add .`

### Log

```
git log
```

Shows commit logs.

### Remote add

```
git remote add origin some-url
```

Manages set of tracked repositories.

### Push

```
git push -u origin master
```

Updates remote refs along with associated objects. The flag `-u` tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do.

### Pull

```
git pull origin master
```

Fetches from and integrate with another repository or a local branch.

### Diff

```
git diff
```

Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

```
git diff HEAD
```

Shows difference of most recent commit, which is referred using the HEAD pointer.

```
git diff --staged
```

Shows staged difference.

### Reset

```
git reset some-file.txt
```

Unstages files.

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Flag `soft` will move HEAD 1 commit back and put changes as they were not commited yet, so you can commit them again.

```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Flag `hard` will move HEAD 1 commit back and delete changes.

### Checkout

```
git checkout -- some-file.txt
```

Changes file back to how it was at the last commit.

### Submodules

Go to root folder.

```
git submodule add some-repo-url some-folder
```

### Merge

git merge --abort

Reset, Checkout, and Revert
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting/commit-level-operations

Check and document those commands.

git branch new_branch_name
git checkout new_branch_name
git merge name_of_branch (checkout to master to merge development branch)
git branch -m old_branch_name new_brach_name (renaming branch)
git branch --merged (showing merged branches that had been merged at any time)
git branch --no-merge (just the opposite as above command)
git branch -d branch_name (deleting branch)
