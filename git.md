### Status

```
git status
```

Shows the working tree status.

### Add

```
git add some-file.txt
```

This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content `staged` for the next commit.

Wildcards are supported, e.g. `git add '*.txt'` or you can add all files by `git add .`

```
