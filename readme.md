ECMAScript 6
------------

A `transpiler` takes ES6 source code and generates ES5 code that can run
in every browser - e.g. Traceur or Babeljs.

### let

In pretty much any other languages, a variable is declared where the
declaration is done. But in JS, there is a concept, called `hoisting`,
which actually declares a variable at the top of the function, even if
you declared it later. [See
more](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp)

By using `let` the variable `name`﻿ is now restricted to its block.

    function getPonyFullName(pony) {
      if (pony.isChampion) {
        let name = 'Champion ' + pony.name;
        return name;
      }
      // name is not accessible here
      return pony.name;
    }

### Constants

When you declare a variable with const﻿, it has to be initialized and
you can’t assign another value later.

    const PONIES_IN_RACE = 6;

### Creating objects

Example:

    function createPony() {
      let name = 'Rainbow Dash';
      let color = 'blue';
      return { name: name, color: color };
    }

can be simplified to

    function createPony() {
      let name = 'Rainbow Dash';
      let color = 'blue';
      return { name, color };
    }

### Destructuring assignment

There is now a shortcut for assigning variables from objects or arrays.

In ES5:

    var httpOptions = { timeout: 2000, isCache: true };
    // later
    var httpTimeout = httpOptions.timeout;
    var httpCache = httpOptions.isCache;

Now, in ES6, you can do:

    let httpOptions = { timeout: 2000, isCache: true };
    // later
    let { timeout: httpTimeout, isCache: httpCache } = httpOptions;

And you will have the same result. The cool thing is that it also works
with nested objects:

    let httpOptions = { timeout: 2000, cache: { age: 2 } };
    // later
    let { cache: { age } } = httpOptions;
    // you now have a variable named 'age' with value 2

### Default parameters and values

TODO.

### Promises

The Promise object is used for deferred (postponed) and asynchronous
computations. A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed
yet, but is expected in the future.

A Promise is in one of these states:

-   `pending`: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.
-   `fulfilled`: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
-   `rejected`: meaning that the operation failed.

<!-- -->

    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      // do something

      if (true) {
        resolve('It worked!');
      }
      else {
        reject('An error.'));
      }
    });

Here's how you use that promise:

    promise
      .then(function(result) {
        console.log(result); // 'It worked!'
      })
      .catch(function(err) {
        console.log(err); // 'An error.'
      });
    ``

    ## Reactive programming

    Reactive programming is a way to build an app using events and reacting to them, using Reactive Extensions﻿ library like RxJS (RxJava...). Apps have evolved to be more real-time: e.g. "likes" to some content can be reflected in real time to other connected users.

    `Listener` is called an `observer`﻿, and the `stream`, `an observable`﻿. A stream is an ordered sequence of events. This is well-known design pattern: the observer﻿ pattern.

    Observables are very close to arrays. An array is a collection of values, like an observable. An observable only adds the concept of values over time: in an array, you have all the values at once, while the values will come over time in an observable, maybe every few minutes.

    Every observable, just like every array, can be transformed:

    - `take(n)`﻿ will pick the n first events
    - `map(fn)`﻿ will apply fn﻿ to each event and return the result
    - `filter(predicate)`﻿ will only let through the events that fulfill the predicate
    - `reduce(fn)`﻿ will apply fn﻿ to every event to reduce the stream to a single value
    - `merge(s1, s2)`﻿ will merge the streams
    - `subscribe(fn)`﻿ will apply fn﻿ to each event it receives
    - and much more...

\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\] .map(x =&gt; x \* 2) .filter(x =&gt; x &gt; 5)
.forEach(x =&gt; console.log(x)); // 6, 8, 10


    RxJS let us build an observable from an array.

Observable.fromArray(\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]) .map(x =&gt; x \* 2) .filter(x
=&gt; x &gt; 5) .subscribe(x =&gt; console.log(x)); // 6, 8, 10


    But an observable is more than a collection. It is an asynchronous collection, where the events arrive over time.

let input = \$('input');

Observable.fromEvent(input, 'keyup') .subscribe(() =&gt;
console.log('keyup!'));

input.trigger('keyup'); // logs "keyup!" input.trigger('keyup'); // logs
"keyup!"


    You can build observables from AJAX requests, browser events, Web sockets responses, a promise, whatever you can think of.

    Observable.create﻿ takes a function that will emit events on the observer﻿ given as parameter. Here it simply emits one event for the demonstration.

let observable = Observable.create((observer) =&gt;
observer.next('hello'));

observable.subscribe((value) =&gt; console.log(value)); // logs "hello"


    Here, the range﻿ method we are using to create the events will iterate from 1 to 5 and then emit the 'completed' signal:

Observable.range(1, 5) .map(x =&gt; x \* 2) .filter(x =&gt; x &gt; 5)
.subscribe(x =&gt; console.log(x), error =&gt; console.log(error), ()
=&gt; console.log('done')); // 6, 8, 10, done


    ### Reactive programming in Angular 2

    The EventEmitter﻿ has a method `subscribe()`﻿ to react to events and this method can receive three parameters:

    - a method to react on `events`
    - a method to react on `errors`
    - a method to react on `completion`

let emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.subscribe( value =&gt; console.log(value), error =&gt;
console.log(error), () =&gt; console.log('done') );

emitter.emit('hello'); emitter.emit('there'); emitter.complete();

// logs "hello", then "there", then "done" \`\`\`
